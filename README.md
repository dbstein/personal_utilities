# personal_utilities
 
This is a collection of python tools that I use commonly, but don't seem to warrant their own package. Perhaps some of them will eventually be developed to the point that they do, but until then, they'll just live in here for easy access.

## What is currently in here

1. The readme
2. Affine transformation module

##Installation
Install by navigating to the package route and typing:
```bash
pip install .
```
The package requires numpy and numba, but will not check that these are installed (in order to protect conda-based installations from pip upgrades).
